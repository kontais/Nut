#                           Nut

  This is a microkernel operating system,targeting at x86_64 platfrom,
originally developed by Li Fei(lifeibiren@qq.com) for personal interest.
The kernel basically consists of three parts,including memory management,
process management, interprocess communication.Any other mechanism is
provided as user-space programs.
  Nut is purely a 64-bit operating system,whose memory management is base
on the paged virtual memory facility.So it could only run on Athlon 64 or
newer processors.
